# Fertilizer prediction using machine learning (ML)

## Overview

Fertilizer prediction using machine learning (ML) involves predicting the type and amount of fertilizer required for a specific crop based on various factors like soil properties, weather conditions, and crop type. Here's a summary of the process:

### 1. Data Collection:
Soil Data: pH level, moisture, nutrient content (N, P, K).
Weather Data: Temperature, humidity, rainfall, etc.
Crop Data: Type of crop, growth stage, etc.
### 2. Data Preprocessing:
Cleaning: Handling missing or inconsistent data.
Normalization: Scaling the data for uniformity.
Feature Selection: Identifying the most important features that influence fertilizer needs.
### 3. Model Selection:
Common models used include Random Forest, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks.
Training: The model is trained on historical data, learning the relationship between the input features and the required fertilizer.
### 4. Model Evaluation:
Testing: The model is tested on unseen data to check its accuracy.
Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate performance.
### 5. Prediction:
The trained model predicts the type and quantity of fertilizer needed based on new input data.
### 6. Optimization:
Fine-tuning the model by adjusting parameters to improve prediction accuracy.
### 7. Deployment:
The model is integrated into a system where it can be used by farmers or agricultural professionals to input data and get fertilizer recommendations.
### 8. Benefits:
Efficiency: Optimizes the use of fertilizers, reducing waste.
Cost-Effective: Lowers the cost of cultivation by recommending the right amount of fertilizer.
Environmental Impact: Reduces over-fertilization, which can harm the environment.

## Algorithm Used

Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is used to predict categorical outcomes, and it has been applied here to classify the suitability of fertilizer types for different crops and conditions.

Naive Bayes: The Naive Bayes classifier utilizes Bayes' theorem and is particularly useful for probabilistic classification. In this system, Naive Bayes aids in predicting suitable fertilizers.

Random Forest: Random Forest is a powerful ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. In some cases, Random Forest achieved 100% accuracy on both the training and testing sets, demonstrating its strong performance.

Decision Tree: Decision trees are used to make decisions by mapping out various options and their possible outcomes. They play a crucial role in understanding the decision-making process behind fertilizer recommendations.

Support Vector Machine (SVM): SVM is a versatile algorithm used for classification tasks. It has shown excellent performance, achieving 99% accuracy in both the training and testing sets in some instances. SVM is instrumental in determining the best fertilizer for specific crop and soil conditions.

##  Technologies Used

HTML: HTML will be used for structuring the content and creating the web pages.

CSS: CSS will be employed to style and format the web pages, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly design.

Bootstrap: Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework, will help in creating a responsive and mobile-friendly layout quickly.

JavaScript: JavaScript will add interactivity to the website, allowing users to submit input, receive recommendations, and interact with the system seamlessly.

Python: The primary programming language for the entire project, used for data analysis, machine learning, and web development.

NumPy: NumPy is a fundamental Python library for numerical computations, providing support for arrays and matrices. It is essential for data manipulation and mathematical operations in the recommendation system.

pandas: The pandas library is used for data manipulation and analysis, allowing efficient handling of structured data such as the dataset containing agricultural information.

Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a popular data visualization library in Python. It is used to create various types of plots and charts to visualize data trends and model performance.
